\section{Reporting Commands ()}
The ``Reporting'' directive or ``report'' is the set of instructions dedicated to retrieve the simulation data and print it to the standar output or, if specified, to a redirected file.

\section{I/O Interaction Commands ()}
The ``I/O Interaction Commands'' or ``rescue'' directive are the set of instructions related to the access to external files from the sequencer.

\subsection{ }
This command is used to start the execution of another nproc file as part of the current nproc execution. This command should be used as:\begin{verbatim}rescue nproc [-silence] <nproc name>\end{verbatim}Where the \textbf{nproc name} is the file to be read and \textbf{-silence} is a flag that allows to silence all the output of this file interpretation so it does not appears on the standard output; nevertheless, this does not affect the redirections.

\section{Variable management ()}
The ``Variable Management'' or ``varman'' directives is the set of all the commands that can be use to set, retrieve or inquiry a variable. These instructions only have an effect (if any) at the environment level as the variables are not dinamically linked in Neuronment.
