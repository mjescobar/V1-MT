# V1-MT
Simulator based on a V1-MT model network

As general rule, each project related to this research must be contained in an independent folder: sources, unit tests, regressions, examples, tutorials, etc. Must be contained in it.

Please, make sure your GIT is correctly configured, specially your user and email. This may become important for tracing proposes.

On your .git/config or on your ~/.gitconfig file, check that the following lines exist:

    [user]
            name = Your Proper Name
            email = name@mailbox.com

"Proper name" means "your name as if you were going to publish it in a journal paper". You don't need to put your name between quotes ("). If your GIT account has a pseudonym that you love very much as "name", there is no problem because this information get stored separately, but if you are committing from the windows or web app be sure it is properly set in the configuration.

The email must be the one you have associated to your authorized GIT account for this repository
