\chapter{Instructions}
\label{ch:instructions}

A command is composed by an instruction, their required arguments and, optionally, a redirection. The redirection has a well defined specific behavior (described on the previous section) and the the arguments will depend on the specific instruction for execution. Under this circumstances, it is possible to use the terms Instruction and Command as synonyms.

As indicated before, an instruction is composed by a Directive and a Sub-Directive. The directives is a way to group different commands with related functionality and the sub-directive is the specific name of the action to execute.

On the following sections there is an exhaustive list of sub-directives grouped by their corresponding directive.
