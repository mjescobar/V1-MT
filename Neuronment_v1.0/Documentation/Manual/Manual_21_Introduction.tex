\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

The \textbf{Neuronment} project is a software intended for discreet simulation and training of complex neural networks for neuroscience studies. Its name comes from the words "Neurological" and "Environment" as the intention is to create a context where different neurological structures can be model, simulated and trained from a simple procedure description file, abstracting all the computational complexities required for the implementation.

\section{How to read this document}

This document is divided in self explanatory chapters divided in 2 groups. Chapters \ref{ch:introduction}, \ref{ch:directives} and \ref{ch:messages} refer to the common application environment and the following chapters have the instructions and details for the different possible neurological simulations and training procedures.

\section{Program execution}

To execute this program it is required the program executable and a "Neuronment Procedure" file (\gls{nproc}). To run it you must execute the following line on the shell:\cite{dummy}
