This software is a computer program whose purpose is to help the 
implementation of spatiotemporal filtering in video sequences. 
Specifically, this library implements the physiological plausible 
filters proposed by Adelson and Bergen (1985).

therefore means  that it is reserved for developers  and  experienced
professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
