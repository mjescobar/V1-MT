/** \mainpage ABFilter library

	This library is available in order to help the implementation of spatiotemporal filtering
	in video sequences. Specifically, this library implements the physiological plausible filters
	proposed by Adelson and Bergen (1985)(*).

	The ABFilter library is based on the creation of entities that could be associated to neurons. 
	Each entity is an ABFilter instance that has assigned a spatial location in the input video.
	Besides the spatial location, an ABFilter instance should also have associated a location in the
	spatial-temporal frequency space.

	The library contains three directories containing:
	\arg \b doc: html and latex documentation of the library
	\arg \b src: Makefile and test sample file (testABFilter.cpp)
	\arg \b include: header and code of the library

	\section libgeneration How to generate the library

	To generate de library, inside src folder, type: 

 	\code make lib \endcode

	\section compilation How to compile
	To compile the test file, inside src folder, type:

	\code make testABFilter \endcode 

	\section run How to run the test file

	Library includes a video sequence in INR format (grating.inr) to test the filtering. You can modify the 
	testABFilter code to load a list of images instead of a video sequence.
	To run the test file with the included video sequence, type for instance:

	\code ./testABFilter -i grating.inr -r 8 -ef 5 -xi 1 -omega 5 -orient 45 \endcode

	If you face any problem do not hesitate in contact me.
