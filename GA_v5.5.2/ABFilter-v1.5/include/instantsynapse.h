// A 'quite' general tool to model instantaneous synaptic transmission, with its possible non linearities. 
//Its parameters are:
//	- Gmax, maximum output value (saturation)
//	- v0, threshold of the function. Transmission is 'compressed' for v<v0, and 'saturated' for v>v0
//	- lambda, slope of the function at point v0 (if power_exp = 1 )
//	- eta, relative sizes of the 'saturation' zone and of the 'compression' zone

//	- power_exp, an 'artificial' exponent to be able to generate power-law synaptic functions
//	Allows to implement transmissions of the type v->v^2 (but in a very complicated way !!!! :-)   )

//The most general formula it implements is, for an input value v :

//  workPoint = ( v > v0 ) ?  lambda/Gmax * pow ( v - v0 , power_exp ) :	//workPoint > 0
//              - lambda/Gmax * pow ( v0 - v , power_exp ) ;			//workPoint < 0

// output = (workPoint > 0 )?   Gmax * ( eta + (1-eta)*workPoint/(1-eta+workPoint) ) :
//           			Gmax * eta * eta/(eta-workPoint);
